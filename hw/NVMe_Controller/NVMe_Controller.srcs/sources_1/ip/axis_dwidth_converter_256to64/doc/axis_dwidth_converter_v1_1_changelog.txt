2015.3:
 * Version 1.1 (Rev. 5)
 * IP revision number added to HDL module, library, and include file names, to support designs with both locked and upgraded IP instances
 * Configurations where there is non-multiple tdata width conversion (e.g., 2:3, 4:3, etc), no TKEEP and  no TID, TDEST or TLAST signals present were found to be adding the TKEEP signal with all bits tied to LOW to the output M_AXIS interface.  The TKEEP output can be ignored in this configuration. While the TKEEP is not needed, it has been kept to not break backwards compatibility and the vector is now being driven HIGH to produce a valid output.  Configurations that require an upsizer (more than 1 input transfer is accumulated into 1 or more output transfers) and have TID/TDEST/TLAST and no TKEEP, will still produce a TKEEP.  The TKEEP in this instance is not always tied HIGH and must be monitored if the input stream is not conditioned to ensure that TID/TDEST/TLAST do not toggle during accumulation.
